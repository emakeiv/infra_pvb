Error:
psql -U pvb_main_user
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432" failed:
FATAL:  database "pvb_main_user" does not exist

The error you're encountering indicates that the psql command is trying to connect to a 
database named pvb_main_user, which is the same as your username. This is because when you don't
specify a database name with the psql command, it defaults to using the username as the database name
